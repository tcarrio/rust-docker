# rust_server

This is a [Rust](https://playrust.com) server docker image. It uses the Linux Game Servers [rustserver]() script and quickly installs, deploys, and starts a Rust server. The required ports are exposed, and the image can be accessed to allow administration from the console. 

Major thanks to the good people at Linux Game Servers making this possible with their great work on the `rustserver` utility.
